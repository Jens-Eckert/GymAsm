There are no negative numbers, why lift nothing?
Your one rep max is 255, no exceptions.
8 bits for 8 reps.
You wanna represent more than that you figure it out.
There are NO floating points because if you're not incrementing by a plate at a time YOU'RE A PUSSY!!!!

2 Sections, `.sets` and `.reps`, sets is data, reps is text section

All hail Sam Sulek.
